A python script useful for generating car leads in the Greater Toronto Area

The email functionality is a(n altered) copy and paste from this source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/60437296

On my desktop I have this script running every 24 hours. I learned how to do that from this informative YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Cr_YRQk7o&t=1s

If you're looking to do something similar to this, I invite you to email me at jamiealizadeh@gmail.com, if I'm not too busy I'm happy to give you a hand with your code 😀

Most importantly thanks a lot to Jason Michael Baumgartner for creating Pushshift (https://github.com/pushshift/api), the API which enabled me to do this. You can support him on Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/pushshift
